I'm Chantel from London UK, and I am an Apprentice Software Developer aiming to complete my apprenticeship in the next couple of months. It has been almost 2 years since I started a Digital Skills Bootcamp, which led me to my apprenticeship which has been life-changing. I have enjoyed the complexity of learning new programming languages such as JS and C#, and I've had fun I've been able to design and create my own frontend too.

Iâ€™m currently working on a financial management application which is inspired by my time as a Financial Educator.  I will be building this using React.js, a framework as I have been using this in my current role.

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
