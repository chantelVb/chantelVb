### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chantel from London UK, and I am an Apprentice Software Developer aiming to complete my apprenticeship in the next couple of months. t has been almost 2 years since I started a Digital Skills bootcamp, which led me to my apprenticeship which has been life changing. I have enjoyed the complexity of learning new programming languages such as JS and C#, and I've had fun I've been able to design and create my own frontend too. 

I realise I have neglected my personal GitHub over the last year as I focused on the apprenticeship and all of my project work is in my work github repository, so I will be working on making the many application ideas stored in my brain a reality. Iâ€™m currently working on a financial management application which is inspired by my time as a Financial Educator. The ultimate goal would be to create an app that could teach young teens about the value of money, so when they start to make money they could see the potential in having savings goals. I will be building this using React.js, a framework I have been using in my current position.
