_Designing with logic, building with heart._

## About Me
I'm a developer and creative technologist from London, UK driven by a passion for blending design, logic and human experience. After beginning my journey through a Digital Skills Bootcamp back in 2021/2022 and a Software Development Apprenticeship at Lumen Research, I have spent the past few years exploring how ideas become intuitive, elegant and intelligent products.

My long term goal is to evolve into a Product Engineer who craft tools that inspire creativity and deepen human connection, and to pursue an MSc in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence to bring that vision to life
